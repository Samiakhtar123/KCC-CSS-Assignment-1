    <ul class="format">

      <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
      <li>External - by using a link element to an external CSS file</li>
      <li>
        The most common way to add CSS. is to keep the styles in external CSS
        files. however, <mark style="color:brown;"> in this tutorial we will use inline and internal
        styles,</mark> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try
        it yourself.
